Sure, let's break it down.
1. Read oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen levels from sensors placed pre- and post-object.
2. Store the sensor readings.
3. Calculate and display the differences in readings every few minutes.

We assume you’re using sensors for **oxygen**, **hydrogen**, and **nitrogen** connected to the Raspberry Pi. We'll have two sets of sensors (pre and post).

### Hypothetical Sensor Setup:
- **Oxygen Sensor**: Connected to GPIO pin (e.g., `GPIO 17` for pre, `GPIO 27` for post).
- **Hydrogen Sensor**: Connected to GPIO pin (e.g., `GPIO 22` for pre, `GPIO 5` for post).
- **Nitrogen Sensor**: Connected to GPIO pin (e.g., `GPIO 6` for pre, `GPIO 13` for post).


### Explanation of the Code:

1. **GPIO Setup**: 
   - The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins are used to read sensor values. I’ve set different pins for each gas (oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen), both pre- and post-object.

2. **`read_sensor` Function**:
   - Reads the sensor values from the GPIO pins. I’ve used `GPIO.input()` as a placeholder. We will need to replace it with the actual sensor reading logic based on the sensors we are going to use.

3. **Saving to CSV**:
   - The `save_readings` function appends the sensor readings to a CSV file with a timestamp. This helps keep a record of the data.

4. **Calculating Differences**:
   - The `calculate_difference` function computes the difference between the post and pre readings for each gas. This difference is then displayed.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The `monitor_gas_levels` function runs in an infinite loop, collecting data every 5 minutes (adjustable via `time.sleep(300)`) and prints the differences for oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.

### Requirements:
- **GPIO library**: since we're running this on a Raspberry Pi, make sure to install the `RPi.GPIO` library with:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio
  ```
- **Sensor-Specific Libraries**: Depending on the type of sensors you use, you may need to install additional libraries (e.g., `Adafruit_DHT` for DHT sensors).

### Sensor Options:
For detecting **oxygen**, **hydrogen**, and **nitrogen**, here are some example sensors:
1. **Oxygen**: 
   - **ZE07-O2** or **SEN0322** are good options for detecting oxygen.
2. **Hydrogen**:
   - **MQ-8**: A hydrogen gas sensor that can be interfaced with the Raspberry Pi.
3. **Nitrogen**:
   - **MiCS-5524** or **MICS-2714** for nitrogen oxides (NO₂).
